The NLUUG is the association for (professional) users of UNIX/Linux, Open Source, Open Systems and Open Standards in the Netherlands. We welcome everyone involved.

The basis of the NLUUG's code of conduct is that we assume that you treat others the way you want to be treated. With patience, respect and empathy regardless of any differences there may be between people. In short: be excellent to each other!

Everyone who cooperates and/or participates in NLUUG events is expected to be aware of our code of conduct and adhere to them. This applies to members and organisation of the NLUUG, but also to guests, sponsors, speakers and all others involved with the NLUUG. These house rules also apply to the (online) services members and non-members can use, such as the mailing lists and FTP server.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants or discriminatory behaviour in any form. To give an idea of undesirable behaviour, here is a non-exhaustive list:

- Racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist or other exclusionary biased or offensive statements or behaviour are not welcome on our site.

- Do not harass people. Stalking, non-consentual physical contact or unwanted sexual attention are harassment. Dressing or behaving in a certain way is not consent.

- Aggression and arrogance are not welcome; everyone should be given ample space & feel safe to ask questions.

- Privacy and confidentiality are important. Ask people's permission before you film, photograph or quote them and respect their wishes.

Should situations arise that do not comply with this, please contact the board at bestuur@nluug.nl. During events, you can also speak to someone from the organisation, after which they can refer you further. The NLUUG will then intervene and take appropriate measures. In extreme cases, a member can be expelled and denied access to NLUUG events.

Do you have any comments on these house rules / code of conduct? Please contact bestuur@nluug.nl

Thanks to PublicSpaces and MCH2022 for providing us with these house rules.
