## Abstract

Turn on the nightly news or your favorite TV drama and you’re bound to hear mentions of a vast criminal underworld for drugs, sex, guns, and identity theft hidden in plain site - all you need is a computer or mobile device to get there - this is the dark web. But what is the dark web really?

While well known, fewer than 1% of internet users have visited the dark web and even among IT security professionals, only 1 in 7 have ever ventured to a dark web forum or site. This lack of direct experience helps explain why there is so much fear and misinformation being spread. But it also suggests that many in the security industry are missing out on a crucial source of information that could help them better protect their enterprise and better get inside the mind of a hacker.

In this talk, we hope to use our knowledge to help break apart fact from fiction and provide you with the basics you, as a security professional, will need to begin safely leveraging this growing intelligence resource to better protect your organization.
