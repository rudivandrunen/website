## Abstract

OwnTracks let you track your own location (hence the name) via your own equipment. It is an Open Source project which produces Android and iOS apps.

In this talk, we tell you a bit about the crazy idea of how OwnTracks came to be, and some of the applications we've know people are using it for. We'll show you some of the eco-system around it. OwnTracks also produces a "protocol" which is implemented in the Recorder and for openHAB and Home Assistant, Traccar, etc.
