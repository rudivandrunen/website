## Abstract

John Yani Arrasjid presents on the evolution of cloud. He uses his perspective as an infrastructure architect for virtualization and cloud, and findings from his research in the Dell EMC and Virtustream offices of the CTO.

Mission critical workloads now run in the cloud based on technical capabilities and automation supporting high SLAs for the enterprise. Mission critical workloads are expecting support for hybridity (on- and off-premise) and multi-cloud (providing choice). New types of mission critical workloads include AI, healthcare, transportation, and industrial IoT.
The cloud is no longer just a sandbox. The capabilities offered through software defined technologies, partnership between IT and OT (Operational Technology) teams, and higher levels of automation and self-healing infrastructures based on machine learning. Examples presented are not exclusive to what is available.
