## Abstract

Containers have been around for a while now. But how do you use them to migrate your software from a traditional architecture to a more microservices oriented architecture? And what about management and scaling once your containers number in the hundreds?

In this talk we will have a look at microservices, how it uses containers and how kubernetes manages all this. Using a webshop as an example, we will look under the hood of kubernetes and see how it all works together.

## Biography

Pieter encountered Linux and Open Source software for the first time in 1992 and never let go. During his studies he played around a lot with Linux and BSD.

Pieter worked in Linux consultancy for most of his adult life and only recently started to work for SUSE as a Sales engineer. In this role he talks about Linux and Open Source all day but still gets to play with the new technologies out there.
