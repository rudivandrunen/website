## Abstract

Adopting new technologies like Docker containers, microservices, Mesos/Marathon, Kubernetes and other “cloud native” solutions, not only creates huge possibilities to increase velocity and scalability, but also introduces a whole new level of complexity. How to implement continuous delivery, service discovery, log-agreggation, API orchestration and secure exposing of service API's and applications? These are all non-trivial challenge which need to be solved before one can safely go to production with such an modern cloud-native stack.

A solution that can handle these requirements in an integrated and unified way can provide great value. It cannot only provide a single “pane of glass” to the underlying components and make them work together efficiently, it can also apply smart metric-driven automation workflows to provide advanced features like canary-relasing, feature-A/B testing and runtime optimisations like SLA based autoscaling.

In this talk, Olaf Molenveld, co-founder and CTO of Vamp.io, will demonstrate how smart service discovery, load balancing, canary releasing, feature testing and autoscaling can be quickly applied to a container scheduler using a unified system.
