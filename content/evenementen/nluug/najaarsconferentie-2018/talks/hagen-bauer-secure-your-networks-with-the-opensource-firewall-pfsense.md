## Abstract

Firewall and network security are a core element of IT (or at least should be). When it comes to the requirements of this crucial component of your infrastructure you should not count on your provider or a manufacturer name. Especially small organizations tend to ignore the risks due to the expected costs and complexity of enterprise devices.

The pfSense firewall is an high performance firewall for the growing needs to this vital element. The software provides functions like high availability, traffic shaping, vpns, network segmentation that are normally only provided by expensive enterprise products.

This way also small organizations and the advanced home office configurations can implement this enterprise capabilities.

In this double talk we will show the need for a new approach, how you can convince your decision makers and demonstrate how easy it is to set up such a configuration in typical use cases without any significant investments.
