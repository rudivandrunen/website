## Abstract

To understand the inner workings of Kubernetes and to prepare of the K8s certification exams, I decided to create a K8s cluster from scratch, the hard way, on premises ("de meterkast") on virtual machines all using Alpine Linux. This talk is how I tried to do it, how I succeeded, failed and added a CEPH cluster and ETCD cluster along the way. It includes a lot of technical details, but if there is one thing that you should learn during this talk, it's not about K8s at all: Containers are not VMs!
