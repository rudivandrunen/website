## Abstract

In 2015, the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG) of the Radiology Department, Radboudumc Nijmegen adopted _deep learning_ for diagnostic image analysis research. This required building custom, on-prem computing infrastructure centered around NIVIDA GPUs. This on-prem solution is effective for experimentation but scaling and maintaining the system remains a challenge.

To address these challenges, we have pivoted away from the on-prem solution towards an in-house developed, large open-source platform called [Grand Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/). This change solves our specific scaling and maintenance issues, and also enhances the visibility of research output in the field in general.

During the presentation I showcase the specific setups and discuss different hardware and software problems that we encountered.
