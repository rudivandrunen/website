## Abstract

TL;DR: I spend 11 months developing a set of playbooks to configure SSO for several open source applications and/to a Keycloak identity server. In my talk I present the process and some gotchas.

The Dutch Onestein organization (specialized in Odoo implementations) invested 11 months of research. Goal was to create a set of easy to use Ansible playbooks to configure single sign-on (SSO) for popular open source applications. This would enable them to authenticate to a Keycloak server as the central identity provider.

These playbooks have been published on https://github.com/onesteinbv/project_single_sign_on and are meant to be a starting point.

The list of supported applications are currently:

- Bitwarden
- CMDBuild
- Jenkins
- Gitlab
- Nextcloud
- Odoo
- Xwiki
- Zabbix
