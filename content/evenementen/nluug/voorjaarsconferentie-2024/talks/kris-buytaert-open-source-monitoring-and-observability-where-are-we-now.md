## Abstract

Over the past 20 years Open Source monitoring and observabillity has changed quite a bit. We went from pure health checks with tools like Nagios, Zabbix , Zenoss, Icinga etc..
Through collecting more metrics with things like Ganglia, Collectd etc. and visualising them with Graphite and later Grafana etc .. We went from “Monitoring Sucks” to “Monitoring Love” …
Prometheus popped up in our industry .. and we learned to deal with logs, metrics and traces.
So where are we today .. how do you monitor and observe your ecosystem with Open Source tools.
This talk will tell you about our experiences running multiple SaaS platforms with 100% open source tools and how to monitor them.

## Biography

Kris Buytaert is a long time Linux and Open Source Consultant. He's one of instigators of the devops movement, working for Inuits.eu / o11y.eu

He started more than one conference series and lost count on how many times he spoke at other events. He spends most of his time working on bridging the gap between developers and operations, while warning people not to make the mistakes he made. He builds infrastructures that can survive the 10th floor test, or a datacenter fire, while actively promoting the devops idea !

He hasn't blogged for a while but people still point out the title of his blog. Titled "Everything is a Freaking DNS Problem", which can be found at http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/
