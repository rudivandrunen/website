## Abstract

Releasing some software as “Open Source” entails a few more steps than simply making it available (or “push to a repo”). Notwithstanding any quality or usability issues, the software, in order to be legally used by others, has to have an appropriate license.

This talk will present the basics of software licenses and legal compliance, from the viewpoints of both the producers and consumers of open source software. The audience will get detailed practical information and will be in position to immediately apply the concepts learned into their daily work.
