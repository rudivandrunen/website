## Abstract

Grav is a modern open-source flat-file CMS built to be _fast_, _flexible_, and _extensible_. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of Grav, it's origins, and it's _many benefits_ over traditional database-powered platforms.

During this comprehensive session we will go step-by-step through the process of creating a personal resume site while touching on many key topics that will enable you to develop more complex sites in the future:

* Installation via __ZIP__, __GitHub__, and __Composer__

* Configuration and customization via __YAML-based config files__

* Making use of Grav's __CLI tools__

* __Markdown syntax__ and Grav-specific content features

* Content __editing and creation__ via the filesystem

* Working with __content media__ such as images and videos

* Understanding the difference between __regular__ and __modular pages__

* Basic __theme modification__, and a quick guide to creating your own __custom theme__

* Overview of Grav's __plugin architecture__ and the __Grav Package Manager (GPM)__

* Including __forms__ utilizing Grav's flexible Form plugin and blueprints

* Optional web-based __administration plugin__

* Grav's powerful __multi-language capabilities__

* Overview of __Scheduler__ and __Backups manager__

* Using GitHub to manage your __deployment workflow__

Participants should bring their own devices if they wish to follow along. They should have PHP 7.1+ pre-installed, a modern browser installed, and be familiar using a text editor.
