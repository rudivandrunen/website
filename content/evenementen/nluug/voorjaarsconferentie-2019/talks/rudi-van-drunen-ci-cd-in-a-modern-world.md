## Abstract

In order to accelerate the process of adding business value a continuous deployment and integration setup is needed nowadays.

In this talk we discuss the way a CI/CD environment can be set up using modern tools and a cloud centric approach, based on dockers that are automatically deployed within a kubernetes cluster after each commit to a source repo. All steps to create a running CI/CD environment aka. the software production line will be shown and demo-ed. The resulting pipeline can be run on serveral open and closed platforms.
