## Abstract

Frank founded ownCloud in 2010. After being the maintainer and CTO, he decided to leave his own project and company in 2016, to start Nextcloud. Most community people and a big part of the customers have followed him to Nextcloud. This talk covers the questions on why this happened and what other community maintainer and start-ups can learn.

This talk will tell the reasons why ownCloud was founded as an open source project, the good and bad things when it was turned into a venture capital funded company, the changes which Frank and the core team wanted for Nextcloud, and how that improved the business model, licensing and community relations.

This talk covers insights into different open source business models and how to create a win-win situation for a company and a community.
