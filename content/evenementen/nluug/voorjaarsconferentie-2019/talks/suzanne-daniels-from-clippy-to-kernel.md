## Abstract

Some of you might remember the iconic picture of Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in front of the “Microsoft ❤ Linux” slide a few years back. Personally I lost track of this company shortly after the retirement of Clippy, so at that time this statement really surprised me. Skip to a few years later: Microsoft is now a major contributor to Open Source, Linux workloads are responsible for ~50% of Azure, and Windows will even ship with a genuine Linux kernel.

In this talk I’ll be sharing more on the Microsoft Open Source journey and we’ll take a look at some services in Azure you might find useful for your (Hybrid) Cloud situation.
