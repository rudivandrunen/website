## Abstract

Freedom and privacy on the internet are under threat, with far-reaching consequences for the daily lives of millions of internet users. Their data are being collected ever more frequently and for an ever longer period. Their access to websites can be blocked. It is even being proposed to cut off users from the internet altogether. Meanwhile, the development of innovative services is also under threat.

The coming years are decisive for the future of privacy and freedom on the internet. Now, we need to ensure that each internet user can decide for her- or himself what happens to their private data. Now, we have to act to make sure that each internet user can continue to enjoy an open and free internet without borders.

This talk wil focus on recent social developments, reflect on the role data, privacy en profiling plays in these and point out what users and business can do to make a change.
