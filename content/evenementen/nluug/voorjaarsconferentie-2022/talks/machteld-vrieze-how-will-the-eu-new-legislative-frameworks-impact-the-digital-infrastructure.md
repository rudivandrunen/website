## Abstract

The legislative machine of the European Commission has made overtime the past few years to make "Europe fit for the digital age"; drafting and negotiating the NISD, CSA, DORA, eIDAS, AI ACT, DMS, DSA, GDPR, telecomcode. See the [Legislative Train Schedule](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age). Digital service providers, online platforms, and providers in the Digital infrastructure are most effected.

In my presentation, I will touch briefly on these frameworks and mainly go into the NISD (Directive on the security of Network and Information systems), the evaluation and the new proposal on the NIS2. This framework has digital service providers and digital infrastructure in scope. NIS2 has not been finalized at the time of my presentation. I will cover the '[general approach](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14337-2021-INIT/en/pdf)', a draft that is still in the process of negotiation.
