## Abstract

Back in 2022, I talked about the future of training courses at AT Computing. Back then, we had some ideas about the final solution and some semi-working environment. Now, 2 years, 3 big sprints, a lot of testing, building, learning, failing, laughing, failing again, starting over and redesigning further we have a live, completely open source based platform and a lot of (open source) insights to share.

Yes, of course the hood will be popped for a tour behind the scenes: it will be a git-repo-uncommon-CI/CD-pipeline-Kubernetes-custom-software-galore.

## Biography

Marcel Kornegoor obtained his Master of Arts degree in Sound and Music Technology back in 2008. He has been a (huge) nerd for most of his life, but will probably deny it when confronted. Nowadays, he works as director of training at the Dutch open source and Linux specialist AT Computing. Being a technology-addict for around 20 years, Marcel provides training courses, talks and writes about cloud technology, DevOps, and other IT and open source related subjects that concern him. Most recently, he started to explore the world of yak shaving.
