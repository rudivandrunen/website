## Abstract

Zero-trust security is a concept that has gained widespread popularity in recent years as a security approach that aims to improve security by eliminating trust in users, devices, and networks. Zero-trust includes continuously requiring user identity verification, limiting access and assuming that attackers have breached an organizationâ€™s networks. However, in practice, it has been found that the zero-trust security approach has caveats.
