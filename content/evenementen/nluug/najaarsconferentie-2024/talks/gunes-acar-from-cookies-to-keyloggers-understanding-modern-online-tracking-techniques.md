## Abstract

The talk will offer an interactive exploration of the online tracking ecosystem, through practical demonstrations and hands-on examples. Online tracking, which involves monitoring user activity across websites and mobile apps, has advanced beyond traditional methods such as cookies. Modern online trackers use more covert techniques such as device fingerprinting, email sniffing, and session recording scripts that operate similarly to keyloggers. Turning to mobile platforms, the talk will explain how precise location data collected from mobile apps can be used to personally identify users and deduce sensitive information. Participants will experience live demonstrations of crawlers and automation tools that researchers use to identify privacy infringements at scale. The talk will conclude with practical recommendations for practitioners and end-users to safeguard user privacy. The talk will be given in English and participants do not need to be familiar with the subjects to follow the talk.
