## Abstract

In an increasingly restrictive internet landscape, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) play an important role in ensuring secure and unrestricted access to the web, however, at the same time, detecting VPN traffic has become a significantly crucial focus for organizations. In my talk, I will explore various methods usually used to identify VPN traffic, such as deep packet inspection (DPI) and traffic flow analysis. Based on my research, I will provide a brief overview of traffic analysis and censorship systems, offering some insights into the evolving techniques used to detect and block VPNs.
