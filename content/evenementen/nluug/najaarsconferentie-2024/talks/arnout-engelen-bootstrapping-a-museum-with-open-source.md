## Abstract

Since 2020, EICAS evolved from an idea without collection, location or money into a full-fledged, officially-recognized museum for modern and contemporary art in Deventer, the Netherlands.

In this technically-oriented talk, I will take you on a whirlwind tour of the open source tools and custom hacks with which we've grown into the 100+-person all-volunteer organization we are today, on a shoe-string budget.

Expect: NixOS, nginx for email, Nextcloud, the Semantic Web strikes back, Roundcube, systemd, DoS mayhem, Fat Thin Clients, Wikipedia edit wars, and much more.
