yes today is about a cautious coast

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,920
two point oh and it's extra assured

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,170
of a second episode of the talk

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,420
i held two years ago so it's

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,710
a bit of a stepchild between then

24
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,430
and now

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,390
this assert this is me i work

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,400
for eighty computing i'm going to go

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,220
owners and director of the company and

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,990
in the past six years i have

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,940
transformed from a normal guy to an

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,970
absurd nerd so it's a bit more

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,890
technical than it used to be before

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,420
but i have a lot of fun

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,100
working at a company and working together

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,640
with a great team

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,520
so yeah a bit about me and

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,660
about eighty computing we were founded back

37
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,670
in nineteen eighty five the founders actually

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,920
here in the in the room and

39
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,450
it's now part of what's called to

40
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,070
their group which is a group of

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,110
trading providing companies

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,470
we provide training as well and also

43
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,350
consultancy and we do only open source

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,930
technology so a linux and everything above

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,590
which evolves infrastructure as code containerization etc

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,620
so we have a strong focus on

47
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,710
devils and bathroom engineering and this is

48
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,000
some of the tools we have for

49
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,200
expertise

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,260
so we also developed some some learning

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,110
paths which are visible at our booth

52
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,640
so if you like it please drop

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,440
by and this is this is what

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,050
we do and what our core businesses

55
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,910
and this is also the reason why

56
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,160
i'm here today because the way we

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,860
develop our training courses has changed quite

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,030
a bit over the last couple of

59
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,330
years

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,790
and i would like to take you

61
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,500
along a bit of a journey how

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,930
we got to the point we are

63
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,410
today

64
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,190
so to get started we will travel

65
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,470
back in time because it's now twenty

66
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,720
twenty four and i was here two

67
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,790
years ago in twenty twenty two and

68
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,080
one of the slides i showed back

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,650
then was this one and this was

70
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,080
basically the id we had back then

71
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,820
so we said well if we have

72
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,800
a training course why why

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,030
don't we see it as being an

74
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,460
application which is written in some form

75
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,100
of goat and with some automation like

76
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,260
she actually pipelines we can deploy that

77
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,720
goat and thus the training inside an

78
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,380
online learning platform and this id was

79
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,930
filled in with some tools so we

80
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,100
said well we are going to write

81
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,770
to the courses in restructured text we're

82
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,560
going to build a container that's transforming

83
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,110
the source code into what's called artifacts

84
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,280
so it can be a pdf it

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,620
can be html or it can be

86
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,470
an e-learning package which there are two

87
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,330
main open standards for which is eight

88
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,560
five b and

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,110
scorm they both are some kind of

90
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,130
archive type of package which contains all

91
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,860
the relevant content for delivering an e-learning

92
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,050
and back then we had the idea

93
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,120
that we would use moodle which is

94
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,400
an open source learning management system or

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
lms and use that as a as

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,720
a provider for

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,390
one or many other lms us to

98
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,640
actually display the course content to the

99
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,900
user or the trainee

100
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,210
and the reason to use a new

101
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,480
spring which a proprietary lms is because

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
we already used it back then in

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,680
our group of training companies so it

104
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,390
made sense to say well let's use

105
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,310
what we have and build something before

106
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,680
it to actually automate it so this

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
was the idea back then and we

108
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,490
had a bit of this income stopped

109
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,080
working so we had to restructure that

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,026
parts are working and some get applied

111
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,430
pipelines but that was about it so

112
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,400
there was nothing functioning on that date

113
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,240
but

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,010
we had a goal and that is

115
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,840
that we wanted to change the way

116
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,570
we use hands on training laps during

117
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,280
our courses because that's one of the

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,990
big parts of our training that you

119
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,270
actually do some exercises in the hands

120
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,740
on level five minutes to get acquainted

121
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,490
with technology

122
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,240
then since gulf times there is a

123
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,400
virtual classroom so if we have a

124
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,410
classroom training there's not only a physical

125
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,740
an option to attend but you can

126
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,680
also join online and the third is

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
that we have the course content as

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,440
i just mentioned that was like the

129
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,952
first starter can we automate the way

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,640
we produce the course content and deliberate

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,300
part way

132
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,540
and the way we do it today

133
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,910
is that we from eti computing have

134
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,370
built our own custom cloud lips so

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,830
it's based on virtual machines which are

136
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,470
deployed with terraform in google cloud and

137
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,120
if you join a training of course

138
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,680
you're using the leps from a from

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,380
a browser and it's it's working pretty

140
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,210
fine but it has some drawbacks when

141
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,480
it comes

142
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,510
to speed of deployment and flexibility

143
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,130
for the federal classroom we are up

144
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,590
to date use go to trading which

145
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,350
is also a proprietary solution it works

146
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,840
perfectly fine but it's a separate system

147
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,320
and for the core software as mentioned

148
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:45,210
of course contents it's a new spring

149
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,060
which is used to deliver the workbook

150
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,720
for the industry

151
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,620
concerned nowadays

152
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,760
and the hottest thing for attendees is

153
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,830
this all these three tools have their

154
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,810
own credentials so if you want to

155
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,220
lose the lap you will have username

156
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,930
and password if you want to use

157
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,880
the online session you will have the

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,380
online classroom you will have username and

159
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,240
password and if you're going to use

160
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,560
the of course content that's is a

161
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,240
separate system with a separate username and

162
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
password you can in

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
imagine that there are some people less

164
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,730
chevy with this kind of stuff than

165
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,250
others so it takes around thirty minutes

166
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,600
to get a classroom up and running

167
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,180
because somebody loses an email containing the

168
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,979
credentials or they do not understand which

169
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,380
system is what so that's a big

170
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,270
struggle for our our customers

171
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,150
so

172
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,630
and other trends why i'm here again

173
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,240
is that our customers say we don't

174
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,180
want classroom training only we want what's

175
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,590
called blended learning and that's why the

176
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,990
blender is here nobody knows exactly what

177
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,060
it is but everybody wants it and

178
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,710
you can see it as a mixture

179
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,800
of different types of learning methods so

180
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,360
it can be partly gloss

181
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,580
from training but also learning and maybe

182
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,050
also some training on the job or

183
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,120
something like that and the combination is

184
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,730
what's called blended learning and this means

185
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,830
that the the need for us to

186
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,290
automate and be more flexible has increased

187
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,090
because we see an increased demand for

188
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,730
customers to say i don't want classroom

189
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,800
training only i want a mixture but

190
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,520
i want your code

191
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,350
then because you will deliver great content

192
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,250
so we deliver have we now set

193
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,020
a new goal and the new goal

194
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,840
is that we combine the lips the

195
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
course content and the virtual classroom altogether

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,100
in one lms and as you can

197
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,340
see it's moodle so we are focusing

198
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,350
to make everything work in moodle which

199
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,080
is the open-source elements and i will

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,530
drop by

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,780
why we made this choice but in

202
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,830
the end for the customer it means

203
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,270
they will only receive one set of

204
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,340
credentials if you can log into moodle

205
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,810
you're good to go and everything else

206
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,340
is within the elements

207
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,290
and to get there we've come a

208
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,470
long way but also we've come pretty

209
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,800
far and this is a timeline of

210
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,410
what we had to endure between the

211
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,970
last time was here and now

212
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,970
so in january two thousand and twenty

213
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,250
three which was right after the presentation

214
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,100
we started working with a group of

215
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,440
four people on like the first iteration

216
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,150
of this id so we actually started

217
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,360
building and we used moodle esa as

218
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,580
our lms and together with a new

219
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,860
spring as mentioned and we still used

220
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,300
the vm labs

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,270
so they are used through apache guacamole

222
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,600
which enables it to make a streamer

223
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,190
for a full browser base to use

224
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,470
and that's how we could deliver a

225
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,860
desktop experience or a terminal emulator and

226
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,330
you can use the lecture that way

227
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,390
so this was the first try but

228
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,190
we bumped into quite a lot of

229
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,940
issues mainly on the new spring site

230
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,730
because the api i was not working

231
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,250
as we hoped so i talked to

232
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,750
the developers for new springs at bulk

233
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,449
we want a ph that have posted

234
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,590
requests so we can upload content automatically

235
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,650
and configure courses automatically it was all

236
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,390
impossible and they did not have it

237
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,650
on the roadmap because there was

238
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,050
for their situation no business case to

239
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,940
implemented because they say well you want

240
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,590
to develop your course content in our

241
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,860
platform that's our business model we said

242
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,300
well we're not going to do it

243
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,550
we want to have our own of

244
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,680
course development and we want your platform

245
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,540
just to play it out but not

246
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,090
to develop your platform so that was

247
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,840
quite a bitch

248
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,700
challenge to see can we work around

249
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,320
it and still use a new spring

250
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,050
but it turned out after two months

251
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,940
of trying that it was not really

252
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,550
feasible so we had quite a bit

253
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,490
of a disappointment because we could not

254
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,960
make it work because there was a

255
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,091
too little openness of the of the

256
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:39,480
apia

257
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,360
then in the summer

258
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,970
we struggled still a bit with it

259
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,400
so we had done some research on

260
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,090
additional

261
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,540
the looks on other lms if that

262
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,580
were available remarks you can we work

263
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,580
around it but we soon noticed noticed

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
that a lot of lms us have

265
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,250
this shame and proprietary limitation so there

266
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,170
are only a few lms us that

267
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,850
have an open ai which you can

268
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,190
create content cautious of course contend with

269
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,360
and one of them is

270
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,695
and it's maybe a bit of a

271
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,345
of a dragon of a product but

272
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,415
it can do everything you want to

273
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,525
do and it has a ph for

274
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,655
everything so it's really open and really

275
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,175
flexible so the big choice we made

276
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,615
in the summer so we're going to

277
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,075
drop into spring it's not the way

278
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,055
forward for us and we're not going

279
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:29,705
to use it and the fun thing

280
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:29,915
is

281
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:31,984
that's after we decided to drop a

282
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:33,785
new spring within two weeks we had

283
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,335
actually a running concept because now we

284
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,895
knew we were going to use moodle

285
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:40,115
and we can start to integrate some

286
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,555
other things because we do not need

287
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:44,165
to worry about another platform that's that's

288
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,415
going along with this also during the

289
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:48,485
same time we dropped the the old

290
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:49,685
fear-based laps

291
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:51,755
and we went to contain a base

292
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:53,645
left and we started using that's the

293
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:56,615
icon there google cloud run which is

294
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,795
their simplest container runtime mo service so

295
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:02,435
she can we use the same lap

296
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:04,655
concept and run electrical diner because the

297
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:06,780
startup time is way way better than

298
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,755
for vms and this way after summer

299
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:10,355
we had a

300
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:12,395
our first version life so we had

301
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,675
an lms with course content and with

302
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:17,495
lapsed at work container based animals integrated

303
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:18,905
so you can use the laps from

304
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,785
from moodle and with this this version

305
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,855
we actually shipped a pilot to a

306
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,820
customer and they did so much from

307
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:28,475
illinois we did and we're pretty satisfied

308
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,515
with the learning experience so we were

309
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:34,025
on the right track but we also

310
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:37,205
noticed that we had some limitations because

311
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,845
google cloud run is quite limited with

312
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:40,685
what you can do it in the

313
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:43,715
container so root privilege it's elevated extra

314
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:46,505
system the running services running containerized workloads

315
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,485
in the container it's all not supported

316
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:50,526
and that is what we need for

317
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:50,675
three

318
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,415
many quarters because we have a docker

319
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,185
of course and it will be quite

320
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:56,135
hard to use docker without a being

321
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:56,975
able to use docker

322
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:01,445
so that's why in january we did

323
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:05,105
another iteration another sprint of development and

324
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:07,595
we said well we're going to use

325
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,025
communities as a platform for our trading

326
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,755
laps and that means like a second

327
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:15,725
complete redesign of our functions but now

328
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,795
we had a good direction so we

329
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:18,275
had a lot of

330
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,915
experience in the meantime we knew moodle

331
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:23,345
back and forwards up to the source-code

332
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,995
we we understand how the system works

333
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:27,905
so we knew how to solve certain

334
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:30,155
problems and with cuban eddies which now

335
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,135
runs on an gk even in the

336
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,875
community scouts will we ever hosted kubernetes

337
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,695
cluster we can now run all kinds

338
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,435
of workloads based on on cuba

339
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,985
eddies which in a voss also nested

340
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:41,915
containers etc

341
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,455
and this means that we now have

342
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,225
version two point oh and that's why

343
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,695
i'm here again because we have had

344
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:51,365
some cool work who stuff and now

345
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:52,655
we can say well we nailed it

346
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,905
the the direction we have chosen is

347
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:56,705
the right one are we going forward

348
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:57,995
in this day in this direction

349
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,115
now you see a strange b that

350
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,875
comes up and that's part of a

351
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:06,665
of an ecosystem i will explain that

352
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:08,285
later on because that's a tool we

353
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,475
developed in-house to make this all work

354
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:12,875
so what does it look like

355
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:18,455
we actually built everything being a git

356
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:20,484
repo so we use git lab as

357
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:24,455
an git repository and in the git

358
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:27,305
leper environment for every training course there

359
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:30,935
is a repository and as repository contains

360
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:32,645
everything that's needed for a training course

361
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:34,115
so that means ever

362
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:35,945
the thing is there for the workbook

363
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,415
for the exercises but also for the

364
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:39,895
lips and with a push towards the

365
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:41,977
the repo a pipeline is triggered and

366
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:43,775
as will deploy the lips we deploy

367
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:47,165
the hiv packages to moodle so it's

368
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:49,325
all in one repository it's all code-based

369
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,785
so it's truly cautious growth and i

370
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,705
will hopefully have a working demo on

371
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:54,245
how it's all

372
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:54,755
coconuts

373
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,065
so as mentioned this does not work

374
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:02,105
out of the box so we do

375
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:04,055
from the start had to division that

376
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:05,015
if there is a two on the

377
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,815
market available we will use it and

378
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,045
we're not going to develop it on

379
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,635
our own but in the end you'll

380
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:11,645
end up developing on your own so

381
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,745
that's what we did and we have

382
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:15,965
created three tools three separate tools

383
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:18,305
the first one to show scottish then

384
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:20,795
we have the sphinx and proctor which

385
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,355
is to beat at you so sure

386
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:22,715
before

387
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:25,535
so kuch this is what you use

388
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,935
as a course developer and it's an

389
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,705
acronym for a course it's called trading

390
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:32,465
update software and it's it's what you

391
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:33,905
use when you create a new trading

392
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,405
or where you want to work to

393
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:38,195
test your training locally and it's a

394
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:41,585
created especially to make the whole process

395
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:43,955
more human friendly because without the altitude

396
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,335
two it involves a lot of creating

397
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:48,455
repositories creating ship modules and gets complex

398
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,855
stuff and this two of the way

399
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:56,345
the second two is an add on

400
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:59,465
to the existing sphinx library that's python-based

401
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,165
to a text processor and this is

402
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:04,805
what we use to make sure that

403
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:07,115
everything we write in our social source

404
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,875
code is converted to a working training

405
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,035
package so we have decouple

406
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:13,685
old the source code and the templating

407
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:15,365
for instance so this makes sure that

408
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:17,405
the source code gets in a nice

409
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,875
layout the way we wanted to to

410
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,345
have look and feel but it also

411
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:22,625
means that if we change a branding

412
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,395
or we want to have a white

413
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,495
label aversion that we can that can

414
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,075
create it from out a sphinx this

415
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:31,985
also has some custom directives because we

416
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:32,165
have

417
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:34,895
quite some specific needs for instance how

418
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:36,455
are you going to integrate a lap

419
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,135
so we created a custom directive for

420
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:39,875
it so you can just type that

421
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,825
you want to lap and the software

422
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,625
will know what you mean and will

423
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:44,315
render it

424
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,745
now this this is not really funny

425
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,545
after nimble to the image issue is

426
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:53,735
a bit of a joke but the

427
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,355
sphinx is an existing too but we

428
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:55,925
adapted it

429
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,375
that was an all things now

430
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,585
and the third and last one is

431
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:04,925
maybe the most important and it's called

432
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,475
proctor and this is actually the two

433
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,515
that does quite a lot when it

434
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:12,695
involves the denzel let because it takes

435
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:15,125
care of authentication so it makes sure

436
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,265
that if you have an account in

437
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:18,275
moodle and you are enrolled in a

438
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,195
given course that you also can do

439
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:20,615
the laps

440
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,107
so it connects moodle and an the

441
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,385
the the authentication from proctor so that

442
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,225
you do not have to log in

443
00:16:26,225 --> 00:16:28,655
again and that it stays up to

444
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,425
date that you have actually rights to

445
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:33,995
use the leftists evolved also it provides

446
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:36,845
a dashboard so that you can check

447
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,075
if a lab is running or you

448
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:40,835
can start one an instantly today

449
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,125
tested or to see if everything you

450
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,385
say is working so that's a that's

451
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,395
a nice feature for for development but

452
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,865
it's also done with her with proctor

453
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:48,725
and under the hood it uses a

454
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,735
key cloak which is an open-source an

455
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:52,835
altercation or two to make sure that

456
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:56,315
everything ft works and this evolved quite

457
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,165
so much development because we wrote a

458
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,995
custom plugin for moodle but also

459
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,515
also contributed to a plugin for authentication

460
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,525
that was already there but had some

461
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,645
less elegant solutions in it so we

462
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,115
pushed it back to the developments that

463
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:12,245
well be i think we improved the

464
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:12,965
deployment

465
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,675
what prosor also does is the lep

466
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,835
orchestration so it actually talks with the

467
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,715
kubernetes cluster and starts jobs and every

468
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:24,875
training has it's own unique jobs so

469
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,615
this way you talked to proctor and

470
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,685
say i want to lab proctor says

471
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,355
to communities start this leapt with this

472
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,785
specification and it will pop up

473
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:36,215
and this is done by a config

474
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:39,665
file so every training course repo has

475
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,055
this a jamo stellt coffee and this

476
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:45,245
is actually a lab definition so you

477
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:46,295
could say i want a lap and

478
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:47,135
this should be the name of the

479
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:49,085
lap it can consist of a single

480
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:51,035
container or it can consist of multiple

481
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:54,515
danish so this example is for a

482
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,255
docker lap but you have a registry

483
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,355
container an additional container so you can

484
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:00,005
push and pull images from from one

485
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,095
to the other within one lap and

486
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,445
this should make sure that the proctor

487
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,905
knows what to deploy an incumbent elissa

488
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:07,865
on the hood

489
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,715
and as mentioned we use communities and

490
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:16,115
the reason is not because we are

491
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:18,125
the biggest fantasy of community because it's

492
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,315
so easy but because it can do

493
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:22,325
a lot on an issue and so

494
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:24,335
there is for our use case not

495
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,435
truly an alternative that s the same

496
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:29,075
flexibility and same options so

497
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,855
so a running near vm stuff root

498
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,225
access etc it's all possible and communities

499
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:37,445
and we did not found any other

500
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:40,745
solution with the same support an ecosystem

501
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:43,565
so this is a a high level

502
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,205
design of how this works i'm not

503
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:47,645
going to step through it in in

504
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,835
too much detail but we have as

505
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:53,435
mentioned a gcp managed control plane and

506
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,835
we run a couple of notes that

507
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,745
dynamically scale up different workloads depending on

508
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:01,565
what your needs are and if necessary

509
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:01,955
if we have a

510
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:05,015
a lot of concurrent chinese it'll scale

511
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,805
out automatically to make sure we deliver

512
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:10,445
what's what's needed and we use the

513
00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:13,293
google cloud secret manager for all secrets

514
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,725
to use of it's mainly integrated in

515
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:18,125
the google ecosystem but that makes it

516
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,315
easier from a management perspective because we

517
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:22,085
have a third form a template that

518
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:24,155
can redeploy the complete environment when needed

519
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:26,495
so it's it's all infrastructure as code

520
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:27,995
for the for the platform itself

521
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:32,675
let's see for the rest there is

522
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:35,255
nothing truly special about the design this

523
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:37,895
is a pretty textbook stuff and best

524
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:40,415
practice when it comes to networking but

525
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:42,455
we have some awesome specific to stick

526
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:45,155
to to make sure these work so

527
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,575
we need external dns because every lap

528
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,145
should be

529
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:51,635
available to the internet so we need

530
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,885
unique your else so we use this

531
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,315
this to to make sure that every

532
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:58,625
lab gets a unique euro that's resolvable

533
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,525
to to the cluster

534
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:03,455
also we use shut miniature to make

535
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,685
sure that all the leps are

536
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:08,045
dispatch with tls so there's encryption not

537
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:10,445
in place it's not and we do

538
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:12,755
not have any special data about disaster

539
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,045
it's nice to do and it prevents

540
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,095
warnings in the in the browser

541
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,415
also where we as mentioned do a

542
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:20,735
lot for also read the first one

543
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:23,255
was the secrets operator and that's is

544
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,395
what i mentioned we use a google

545
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:25,865
c to a secret engine but we

546
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:27,575
have a plugin on communities to interact

547
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:29,225
with it and this is for dns

548
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:31,325
so we every lab has it's unique

549
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:32,525
dns entry

550
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:37,085
ingress is done by the engine extra

551
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,905
ingress controller and last but not least

552
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:42,095
we use a special runtime and that's

553
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:44,765
called chatbox chatbox is an open source

554
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,045
project that enables you to run system

555
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,155
d workloads and near vm experiences on

556
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:53,825
kubernetes show it's an alternative

557
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:56,195
to cryo or owls whose goals i

558
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:57,665
believe contain a d which is also

559
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,525
runtimes for our communities but we use

560
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,135
this box for for our desired workloads

561
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:05,885
and as mentioned proctor our special orchestrator

562
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:10,205
for for this so if the democrats

563
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,615
are a bit well willing i will

564
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:13,805
show how this works in practice so

565
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:16,415
what i'm going to do is here

566
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,365
life create a new training course from

567
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,885
scratch so there's nothing running now and

568
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:22,805
let's see if we can get it

569
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:23,345
working

570
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:23,465
ng

571
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:29,195
let's see

572
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:34,025
alright so i'm in a directory here

573
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:35,375
and what i'm going to do is

574
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,465
use your cactus so uncles a cactus

575
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:42,365
create an eye for sneak because i

576
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,825
do not nautical ments all my heart

577
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:46,115
let's see

578
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:52,625
i'm not a machine but this a

579
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,665
creates a new course

580
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:58,265
so i will explain what it does

581
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:00,395
it will say create a new course

582
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,735
choose a language which is english or

583
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:05,555
dutch give it a release or initial

584
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,985
initial release give it a title and

585
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,755
give it a unique name so in

586
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:11,045
this case i will call it an

587
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:12,815
aloof and that's all i need to

588
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:14,975
do and a cactus now we will

589
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:15,395
create

590
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,065
in the back everything that's needed for

591
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,595
our trading skeleton

592
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:22,295
so here we go it will clone

593
00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:24,845
some awesome default some templates or repositories

594
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,805
of a burp yeah it is complains

595
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,035
a bit i'm not saying we are

596
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:31,955
bug free but it's a it's working

597
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:35,133
and now this is a this is

598
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:36,905
get lap if i refresh the browser

599
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:38,885
we now see that we have a

600
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,235
new trading gold and luke

601
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,655
and there is some templating already in

602
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,415
the in the repo and now we

603
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:48,125
have a basic scaffolding for it for

604
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,595
the trading so you see the conficker

605
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,245
file weird so read me there's a

606
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,945
makefile for for building the lab and

607
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:56,476
now we have our our course in

608
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:58,775
a hit

609
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,075
but we still need to do something

610
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:03,605
else and that's that we need to

611
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:06,545
add a topic or a chapter to

612
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,165
the course so

613
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:11,735
of course normally in our classrooms reservation

614
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:15,515
is built up around chapters unification yes

615
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,933
and doesn't matter in this case shoot

616
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,255
the students should have met her i

617
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:29,615
guess

618
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:38,795
yeah i could try it it will

619
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:40,385
it will fail probably if it's not

620
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,455
working it might be two things it

621
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,715
works or it will say you're not

622
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,905
in the right directory so let's see

623
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,125
about what i'm going to do now

624
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,805
is to add a new directory or

625
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,265
a new show technically it's a short

626
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,305
module with a new in this case

627
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:56,405
a new topic and this is called

628
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,085
zero on the demo this is the

629
00:23:58,085 --> 00:23:59,345
name of the topic but it can

630
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:02,015
be anything else and i referring to

631
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:04,025
a specific branch here and that's because

632
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:06,095
version three point o is our stable

633
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:07,985
branch and that makes it work so

634
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:09,485
let's see what it does it's a

635
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:10,295
you're right

636
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:13,295
so this should work

637
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:17,345
so now it's closer the the the

638
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:19,505
chapter or the topic of repo and

639
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:20,975
now if you go back to kit

640
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:24,455
and go to docs and refresh it

641
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:25,805
there should be

642
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:27,755
there should be

643
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:30,305
there should be

644
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:31,789
another

645
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:35,045
i dunno it's it's true yep it's

646
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:36,365
a bit quirky but now i have

647
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:36,665
to

648
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:40,505
to push it to to edit

649
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:43,895
so i need to add the new

650
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:45,755
module to it

651
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:48,815
the first commute

652
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:51,275
and push it

653
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:54,065
we're still working on like this flow

654
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:57,575
to have some extra arguments for cactus

655
00:24:57,605 --> 00:25:00,035
that this is done ultimately but now

656
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:02,105
it shoots contain

657
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:07,085
mom can do it yes there it

658
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,855
is so now the shop window is

659
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:11,195
connected to the course and we have

660
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:12,095
have our trading

661
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:15,785
up and running so now i need

662
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:18,215
to copy some some stuff so i

663
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,235
will make sure i'm in the right

664
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:19,775
directory

665
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:24,395
and what i'm going to do now

666
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,335
i prepared a small coffee file i

667
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:29,375
will copy it and i prepared a

668
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,985
small demo course which i'm going to

669
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:33,575
copy and

670
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:37,025
this otherwise would have taken a lot

671
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:37,445
of time

672
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,585
why is it not working

673
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:43,775
michigan

674
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:48,395
two

675
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:50,555
she

676
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:53,165
should be

677
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:00,785
cannot stand my eyes and working

678
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:04,685
she

679
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:06,965
yep

680
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:11,465
hmm

681
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:15,215
now it's working we need to edit

682
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:15,785
again

683
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:19,745
the roach and confused

684
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:23,555
in addition to going to work

685
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:26,855
i need to edit here too

686
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,905
show first push the shipping will do

687
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,785
vertical mirror for this one

688
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:36,965
our second commit we are this is

689
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,165
a sub module this is the first

690
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:38,315
one

691
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:44,525
let's see an hour to two days

692
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:45,785
and coffee

693
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:48,335
can we get any names

694
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:51,065
hello

695
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:56,915
i need to type it right

696
00:26:58,175 --> 00:27:00,815
alright so now we have our scaffolding

697
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:03,605
for for training and let's see what

698
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:06,425
it's what it looks like so we

699
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,195
have this just like our course based

700
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:11,075
directory and this contain said the the

701
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:13,235
getting up cfl but this only contains

702
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,336
a reference to a default pipeline that

703
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,775
said we didn't get lap so not

704
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,095
every training has a unique

705
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,615
a huge pipeline fell but it only

706
00:27:20,615 --> 00:27:23,285
refers to a standard pipeline we have

707
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:24,635
in and get left so we have

708
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,095
a separated the infrastructure part from the

709
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,525
course development part so that as a

710
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,664
trainer if you are developing the of

711
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:32,375
course it's more of a creative process

712
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,295
you need to worry as little as

713
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:36,995
possible around older infrastructure and stuff that's

714
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:38,465
needed on the on the background so

715
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:40,475
there is a separate team working on

716
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,455
the infrastructure and a separate team working

717
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:43,415
on the course content

718
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:46,565
then we have to convert film and

719
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,815
this contains all the settings that we

720
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,245
require for our training course so in

721
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,730
this case it will take contain a

722
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:55,895
trading gold trading name the language and

723
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,365
in this case an h five b

724
00:27:57,365 --> 00:27:59,135
settings so we can decide if you

725
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,525
have a simple question should it contain

726
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:03,905
the answer or not so you can

727
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:04,205
use it

728
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,215
as as a quiz or you can

729
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:07,625
use it as a as an xml

730
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:09,605
for instance so these are all settings

731
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,135
that you can adapt and as you

732
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:12,845
can see here there's also a lecture

733
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:15,965
directive that's defining what the left should

734
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:17,255
look like while base image the original

735
00:28:17,255 --> 00:28:19,505
dockerfile to restore to use and in

736
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:20,825
this case there will be a demo

737
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,585
rockefeller to build to the library environment

738
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:27,695
so within the docs directory there is

739
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:30,485
the demo directory and there's the rst

740
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,705
file so this is actually the course

741
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:36,065
content so now we have a slight

742
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:38,015
which has hello all and there is

743
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,665
a multiple choice question in here there

744
00:28:39,665 --> 00:28:41,855
is an image and here there is

745
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:45,665
ilab so this is accustomed directive this

746
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:46,655
is all you need to do to

747
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,365
say i want a lap here and

748
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,225
put it in the inequality

749
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,675
and of course we have a left

750
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:56,585
directory and that contains an example dockerfile

751
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:58,175
i'm not going to show the demo

752
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,005
dockerfile because it contains some stuff that

753
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,285
makes you able to to change the

754
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:04,865
outcome of your trading so what it

755
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:07,865
looks like it's just a normal dockerfile

756
00:29:07,865 --> 00:29:09,665
so there's nothing special here it's just

757
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,555
a dockerfile and it contains

758
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:13,415
some are special think so

759
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,295
we copied the home directory where you

760
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,095
can put the exercises in and we

761
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,765
copy if you have a test so

762
00:29:20,765 --> 00:29:23,165
you can test your lap and we

763
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:25,145
use technical mumbo to check if you

764
00:29:25,145 --> 00:29:27,365
have done something if it's actually working

765
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,835
so that is also copied and we

766
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,695
run some post install script to make

767
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:31,775
sure that the settings from the lab

768
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:33,695
are all defined as as we need

769
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:37,925
so this should be always your rockefeller

770
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:39,695
but for the rest you can build

771
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,555
custom images you can do as everything

772
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:43,265
you would normally do with with docker

773
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:46,235
in this case i have written some

774
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:48,395
tests so this is just a shell

775
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,435
script are doing some muslim actions and

776
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:54,035
changing some checking showing muslim values and

777
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:56,135
this is actually the way we we

778
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,875
write a check it's it's called best

779
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,425
units which is a besh based testing

780
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,075
framework so in this way we can

781
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:04,322
let see what the desired outcomes should

782
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:04,595
be

783
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,125
and if it corresponds with what you

784
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,235
have done in the in the lab

785
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:12,875
and and also there is a home

786
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,645
directory is here and just to show

787
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,565
that it's a unique directory this contains

788
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,755
fl company named hello

789
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,760
andalusia aspects fixing it so just to

790
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,990
show that it's a unique lap

791
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,840
alright so now we have everything up

792
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,190
and running and all the rest all

793
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,380
the other files are just necessary for

794
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,210
making this stuff works i'm not going

795
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,770
to talk in detail because that's all

796
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,140
the infrastructure stuff that's a that's a

797
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,640
geostationary you do not have to worry

798
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,900
about it as a as a traitor

799
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,570
but we can have some some fun

800
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,700
with this because i now have this

801
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,110
trading and i can use

802
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:44,590
this

803
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,940
two lens to see if everything is

804
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,860
is good so now it's it's working

805
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,560
so this training course has fell it's

806
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,840
a syntax so they're enormous no mistakes

807
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,340
in it but if i now for

808
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,460
instance a let's see in the coffee

809
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,680
diaper something here

810
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,920
again it will produce an error who

811
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,530
say well there is something wrong with

812
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,200
your visual foul because i expect this

813
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,240
these failures and you have something else

814
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,940
so this is really helpful from a

815
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,220
software development perspective that you can test

816
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,830
locally if your syntax is a is

817
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,300
ok before you push it to the

818
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:22,990
to get regular

819
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,230
so it should be find out and

820
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,840
the same goes for the hsbc index

821
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,420
if you mess up a directive it

822
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,010
will produce an error so this has

823
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,170
served us political and what i now

824
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,360
can do is use a local version

825
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,400
of the out a sphinx to actually

826
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,850
make

827
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,360
this training course so i'll now building

828
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,100
it and i can use it locally

829
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,380
it's bills

830
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:52,060
it's called phoenix so now i've built

831
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,940
the e-learning course locally and i can

832
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,290
use leumi which is an open source

833
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,410
tool for viewing hsp or auditing and

834
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,120
now i have my training course so

835
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,000
this is a working learning containing the

836
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,520
the picture i can provide an answer

837
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,180
check it

838
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,740
and i also have my lepanto here

839
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,660
with the question

840
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,420
but the laps do not work locally

841
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,250
this way because of altercation etc i'm

842
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,010
not running running kubernetes nor proctor but

843
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,170
you can see that it's detecting there

844
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,130
should be a lap here

845
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,980
so this is really powerful that you

846
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,410
can offline completely on your laptop check

847
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,580
if everything's working

848
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,770
but what is also possible

849
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,710
is if we go to the

850
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,140
the next directory i can run the

851
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,180
laps locally so i can loose i'm

852
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:45,220
using padma that also works with with

853
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,580
docker

854
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,770
i have to come on here this

855
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,280
easier

856
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,470
to be here

857
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,360
true to do

858
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,960
that works quite well up to now

859
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,610
so our drinks to probably

860
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,510
yep i can just use the dockerfile

861
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,950
and build it locally so i'm using

862
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,100
the demo dockerfile and do not show

863
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,720
what it actually does because of her

864
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,840
secrets that it contains but i'm taking

865
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,330
it with the luke and now it

866
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,180
shoots to build it and i can

867
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,750
run it

868
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,610
so there we go it's now running

869
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,590
and if i open a browser locally

870
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,600
and i go to the port i

871
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,210
published that now we have a trading

872
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,660
lap running containerized on our laptop so

873
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,310
this way you can also test all

874
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,830
the training exercises locally on your laptop

875
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,990
just in your browser so i

876
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,820
prefer written the test script which was

877
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,070
cold and aloof and i can show

878
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,990
it this contains the demo directory

879
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,070
which contains the hello file and if

880
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,600
i got it it says in luke

881
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,670
shaw everything we have defined isha is

882
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,790
there but as mentioned i've written a

883
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,590
test so if i now say check

884
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,620
with test it will provide an answer

885
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,330
but i have not done the exercise

886
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,800
yet so this is the wrong answer

887
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,810
but if i now run the script

888
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,670
to test it which was cold and

889
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,030
aloof

890
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,360
it will now create that directory and

891
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,910
create a file that wasn't there before

892
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,860
and it will say the correct answer

893
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,470
should be this answer so now we

894
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,660
have tested the lep exercise and we

895
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,610
know that it's actually executable that are

896
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,650
no mistakes and that it actually performs

897
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,120
the way we expect it to to

898
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,040
perform so now if i again run

899
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,880
the check command

900
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,580
it will provide the correct answer because

901
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,200
we now have actually done the exercise

902
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,850
and this is all done locally so

903
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,740
this prevents a lot of pulling and

904
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,930
pushing towards get left because you can

905
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,640
just dessert and push it back then

906
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,870
so this looks pretty good so now

907
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,210
we have working of a coarser content

908
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,710
we have a working lab and now

909
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,550
we can push it to

910
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,170
to to get lip but before we

911
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,300
do are any questions so far

912
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,250
yes

913
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:58,540
yes

914
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,150
i'm going to show it because uh

915
00:35:07,153 --> 00:35:08,110
yeah there is a lot of this

916
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:09,940
debate and discussion but in anti computing

917
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,040
whether to use them or not because

918
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,900
they're quite complex abstracts they are bitter

919
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,760
and friendly sometimes but

920
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,900
i will show it immediately why why

921
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,190
we use it and why it's fun

922
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,250
let's go back to the

923
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,040
train the directory yep

924
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,100
the reason why we used to use

925
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,110
this is because we can do this

926
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,640
we can add another topic but not

927
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,220
a chapter from a completely different rating

928
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,140
so in this case i'm going to

929
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,690
add it my and luke training course

930
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,960
a directory from our python threading which

931
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,310
is a completely different rating but it's

932
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,960
also gets something to do so if

933
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,470
i do this

934
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,767
is when our clone it into the

935
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:58,330
docs directory and now i have zero

936
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,790
too and this has the same structure

937
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,930
this is a bit of a different

938
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,340
training so it has some more stuff

939
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,920
to it but this is now added

940
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,430
to my content so if i go

941
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:13,509
back to this directory and create a

942
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:14,320
build directory

943
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,620
and create a trophy again

944
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:19,630
there we go

945
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,650
a b produce some warnings but that's

946
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,020
not too bad i now am i

947
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,370
build directory f

948
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,590
zero two

949
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,380
it's a second chapter

950
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,350
and there we go now we have

951
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,870
python training as part of our training

952
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,820
course so this is the reason why

953
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,010
we use automobiles because if we have

954
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,360
a customer that says well i want

955
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,830
some topics from this writing have some

956
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,540
topics on the training we can now

957
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,250
say well aware this is your menu

958
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,560
choice just edit and

959
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,600
render a completely unique new e-learning

960
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,480
meaning

961
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,050
yes guess it's a bit of an

962
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,780
idealism because you need to make sure

963
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,870
that this course content has like a

964
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,920
head and a tail on it's own

965
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,110
because if it's a ongoing story it's

966
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:12,460
pretty hard to say well i want

967
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,600
the middle part but it's technically feasible

968
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,790
and especially if you're having

969
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,820
in some smaller topics you can conduct

970
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:24,670
an own unique trading pretty easily this

971
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,620
way so this this is why we

972
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,520
why we use it and how we

973
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:27,790
use it

974
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,500
guess

975
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,890
nope we've dropped by

976
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,580
because they upload a pretty badly

977
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,020
but the fun thing is that also

978
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,000
this a training course contains a lap

979
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,460
so i'm not sure if it's here

980
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,830
i don't know the course

981
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,100
my top of my mind but there

982
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,780
should be also if if there's leps

983
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,370
in this course it should also work

984
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,420
because it's part of the of the

985
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,780
course

986
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,750
alright so now i need to add

987
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,890
this to the repo so good and

988
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,460
dogs

989
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,340
and it's commute again

990
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,220
and biotin

991
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,577
bush and now switch over to get

992
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:25,780
that because now there should be pipelines

993
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,110
running

994
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,630
where is it here

995
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,340
there we go so it's now running

996
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,950
a pipeline i see it filled not

997
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,480
sure why but we'll see

998
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,320
and this actually is a now failing

999
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,710
orleans

1000
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,440
that's interesting why is it

1001
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:47,200
it's a demo

1002
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,400
unable to access it has some permission

1003
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,040
issues going to have one quick look

1004
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,340
might be that at the the module

1005
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,850
is one

1006
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,420
the privates should be internal i guess

1007
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,560
this is annoying

1008
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,340
we came pretty far it should be

1009
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,360
internal i guess

1010
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,030
i will run it again to see

1011
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,440
if this assaulted

1012
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,030
let's see

1013
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:28,060
run again

1014
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,300
there you go

1015
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,420
if it survives linting face it should

1016
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:34,810
be fine

1017
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,390
because everything else we have tested locally

1018
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,670
and hit repos testing locally is a

1019
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,960
bit hard to it now produces a

1020
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,920
warning which is

1021
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,730
all right so complaining about summer some

1022
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,260
layouts or stuff so that's not a

1023
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,520
breaking change i guess

1024
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,380
or breaking a thing it's still running

1025
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,580
so this this is good this is

1026
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,170
good so what i will do in

1027
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,630
the meantime is show you our this

1028
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,760
is our testing environment for our moodle

1029
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,399
environment so this is actually moodle and

1030
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:11,410
we've customized it to a bit for

1031
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,450
look and feel but i already created

1032
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,220
an aloof demo where trading

1033
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,460
of course and this will contain the

1034
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:20,320
the h five p in a bit

1035
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,360
so we will have to wait for

1036
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,210
the pipeline to where to run if

1037
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,770
are any questions in the meantime please

1038
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,570
feel free it will take a couple

1039
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:28,960
of minutes

1040
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,580
it's it's done through the pipeline so

1041
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,350
the pipeline connects to the the the

1042
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,937
moodle a b i and will upload

1043
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,480
the hiv

1044
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,660
now it's a hsp it's just a

1045
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,053
package for moto moto has the capabilities

1046
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:51,980
of displaying a trophy it doesn't need

1047
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,110
to know anything else so we will

1048
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,520
see how it's how it works but

1049
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,340
now if the pipeline is completed it

1050
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,593
will

1051
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,830
it's taken quite long show

1052
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,120
might be that the user information that

1053
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,280
we fished or it's building the laps

1054
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,060
now so

1055
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,110
it's now building the container left but

1056
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,160
it will push the d h five

1057
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,600
b to the to the test environment

1058
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,140
and disaster at the dashboard i mentioned

1059
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,610
and if i refresh it it should

1060
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,160
contain the luther lap within a couple

1061
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,520
of minutes

1062
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,650
it's taking a bit long

1063
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,420
you can do it

1064
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,800
it's always quick when you don't need

1065
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:36,920
it

1066
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,740
go on

1067
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,220
while we have five minutes left shower

1068
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,090
there is already the the demo created

1069
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,290
i'm not sure if it will run

1070
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,520
because it's still creating but proctor knows

1071
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,720
that the lab has been edit

1072
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,180
yes

1073
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:03,530
yes

1074
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,480
and as far as i know it's

1075
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,880
a bit out of my comfort zone

1076
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,650
but i think it's wonky cloak instance

1077
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,920
which is referred to with it's synced

1078
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,360
with the moodle accounts

1079
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,530
yes just

1080
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,120
let's see it's not doing anything yet

1081
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,520
so the lepage center there is a

1082
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,750
bit annoying that it takes so long

1083
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,000
because there's normally it goes faster it's

1084
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,460
now says that it should be there

1085
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,800
so let's go back and refresh this

1086
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,370
alright

1087
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:45,380
i started

1088
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,520
yes so now it's a actually from

1089
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,770
the dashboard deploying the new let we

1090
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,080
created so the stakes are because it's

1091
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,970
now actually deploying on the kubernetes cluster

1092
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,790
twenty seconds ish tool to deploy that

1093
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,890
up there it is and now we

1094
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,260
have the lab running and if you

1095
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,880
opened it in the browser it will

1096
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,740
work it will work the reason

1097
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,960
i did not have to authenticate is

1098
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,670
because i already locked in to moodle

1099
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,070
so it uses a cookie and is

1100
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,480
already knows that i'm enrolled in this

1101
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,800
course that i have the permission to

1102
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,600
use the lab but if you open

1103
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:18,830
this on your own laptop it will

1104
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,050
say it will show up the the

1105
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,550
locking screen like we saw in the

1106
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,780
in the local demo

1107
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,530
let's see is it finished

1108
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,390
it's failed

1109
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,780
oh no why did it feel

1110
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,570
i feel to build a comp the

1111
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,600
contents and that's a shame but i

1112
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,270
have an older version already here so

1113
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,740
this is what it should look like

1114
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,310
a let's see now it's not there

1115
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,530
maybe there's an older version that i

1116
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,300
can use because this is where you

1117
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,370
actually connect the hf befell to the

1118
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,020
trading course so here

1119
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,390
search the package and i can delete

1120
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,210
it because we have a placeholder and

1121
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,680
now there should be an aloof

1122
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,110
there it is maybe there's an old

1123
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,486
version because i've already tested it's a

1124
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,000
couple of days so it's a shame

1125
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,480
fell

1126
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,790
now if a display it you will

1127
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,170
see the same content that we saw

1128
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,150
locally here it is so now it's

1129
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,680
in our learning platform and we can

1130
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,360
use it to ship to wear to

1131
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,250
our customers and here you can see

1132
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,320
there is a lap and it's also

1133
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,360
knows that i already have a leapt

1134
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,280
for this training running so this is

1135
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,840
the same lap as here so if

1136
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,770
i say hello

1137
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,590
you see hello here so it's it's

1138
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,850
the same connection

1139
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,130
yes we do and it has technical

1140
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,750
reasons i'm not too aware of but

1141
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:40,760
we tested the last of this works

1142
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,970
best with key strokes and this kind

1143
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:45,170
of stuff because we had some trouble

1144
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,310
and that's possible because you have to

1145
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,800
shame the shame you out so i'm

1146
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,080
actually now this can be the traitor

1147
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,910
from the dashboard and i can have

1148
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,700
the same session as the twenty so

1149
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,920
that's possible because if i go back

1150
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,500
to the dashboard i can see one

1151
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,330
the active leps here so i can

1152
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:08,900
just join us

1153
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,930
so while i'm looking with you now

1154
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,180
that's why this one of the main

1155
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,500
reasons we have the dashboard as well

1156
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,200
too for student support yep so now

1157
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,970
i can run the same script and

1158
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,588
it should work because we tested it

1159
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:22,670
to already offline

1160
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,890
so now we have in our lms

1161
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,200
our open source lms completely as course

1162
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,230
built of course that didn't exist before

1163
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,700
the session and now russia is life

1164
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,040
running in our learning platform it's all

1165
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,500
open source based and we also have

1166
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,850
the ambition to open source the tools

1167
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,550
we developed in-house to if you would

1168
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:43,940
like it

1169
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,770
i can build this yourself or with

1170
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,930
some some additional knowledge of communities google

1171
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,730
cloud and as she actually pipelines

1172
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,990
all right so we have one minute

1173
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,720
left but that's not too bad because

1174
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,090
the last two slides are are a

1175
00:45:59,102 --> 00:46:00,920
roadmap we have still some challenges

1176
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:02,870
maybe ish

1177
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,350
as you have seen it's still has

1178
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,730
some rough edges we still need to

1179
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,010
polish on things we also have some

1180
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,650
challenges when it comes to a persistency

1181
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,660
and startup times of the lips so

1182
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,220
weird a tweaking to make them even

1183
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,950
faster and also if you're taking a

1184
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,080
course of multiple days it would be

1185
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,970
nice that you have persistent data between

1186
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,260
the first second and third day

1187
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,150
so that has some challenges for some

1188
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,310
muslim laps and also we have some

1189
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,980
worries about realistic real to real-world scenarios

1190
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,900
for terraform and ansible how are you

1191
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,390
going to deploy a real resources or

1192
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,810
provision so muslim infrastructure and also how

1193
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,490
are we going to run kubernetes winning

1194
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,150
communities to host our communities training in

1195
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,360
this

1196
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,860
leps as well so we're not there

1197
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,750
yet but we can do docker we

1198
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,910
can do that didn't show with but

1199
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,100
we can run nested containers and have

1200
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,530
a docker leper in in this distribution

1201
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,810
as well so it's pretty cool and

1202
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,460
we are looking at two feared to

1203
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,010
see if we can make things even

1204
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:01,910
even better

1205
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:08,180
and from mortal course site and we're

1206
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,520
trying to ultimate as well the course

1207
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,130
creation in moodle because i've done it

1208
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,720
by hand now but we are writing

1209
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,770
our own terraform

1210
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,120
plugin devil can talk provision of course

1211
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,190
in moodle fire terraform so that's a

1212
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,740
that's on the roadmap and also we

1213
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,040
have some issues with reporting scaling also

1214
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,840
web to the teaching this idea to

1215
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,580
our colleagues from other companies that are

1216
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,650
a bit less less tech savvy his

1217
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,210
challenge to to say that this is

1218
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,890
quite elegant and andy

1219
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:38,780
so we have some awesome things to

1220
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:38,960
do

1221
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,830
but there were making steps and we

1222
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,290
have also under meanwhile contributed to quite

1223
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,118
some open source projects because we fixed

1224
00:47:47,118 --> 00:47:49,430
bugs we found some interesting quirks and

1225
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,950
features so it has been a great

1226
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,450
journey to where to get where we

1227
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:53,630
are

1228
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,650
alright any questions i think we have

1229
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,850
zero seconds left

1230
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,990
yes got one sorry

1231
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,640
yes it does pdf html hiv and

1232
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,710
maybe some other formats as well yep

1233
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,380
any other questions

1234
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,100
i can i can i can shoot

1235
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,800
so the question was how does a

1236
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,540
big blue button for the federal classroom

1237
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,730
fit in this is actually something i'm

1238
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,750
not sure if it's in a test

1239
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,440
environment

1240
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,320
it's integrated as well with the within

1241
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,600
moodle so we are going to run

1242
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,030
a pilot's course this week

1243
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,810
where is it's i think here

1244
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,560
yep so this is just a topic

1245
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,610
in a moodle and this is the

1246
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,070
virtual classroom so if you join session

1247
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,990
here you will go to the physical

1248
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,210
classroom so it's all integrated in the

1249
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:53,600
institute

1250
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,860
alright i'm here for the rest of

1251
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,240
today so if you have some questions

1252
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,853
