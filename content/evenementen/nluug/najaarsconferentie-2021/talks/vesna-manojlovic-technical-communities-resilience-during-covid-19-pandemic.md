## Abstract

As a Community Builder in the RIPE Community, since March 2020 I've been working on organising the support for community that is struggling with isolation, grief, anxiety etc due to the pandemic. In 2021, together with a small "task force" we have organised a survey, had several online meetings, published articles on RIPE Labs and gave several talks.
