## Abstract

The NLNOG RING is a platform for troubleshooting networking problems from different vantage points in the world.

In this talk, I will give an introduction on what NLNOG RING is, how the project came to be, and how it has evolved over the ten years of its existence. I will also share details about the tools we use for managing the increasingly large constellation of servers and the challenges we've encountered with this along the way.
