## Abstract

This is a talk about the status of the planned DNSSEC root key rollover. The first part of the presentation is an introduction to DNSSEC and will cover how DNSSEC works and which keys are involved, why keys are rolled in DNSSEC, and how keys in DNSSEC are updated and retrieved by DNSSEC validators.

The second part of the presentation will cover the scheduled root key rollover, including the original time-line, the new methods to get an insight in the current status (and its limitations) and the reason why the key roll is postponed.

The last part will cover a study performed by Open Netlabs on the state of the RFC5011 implementation in various open source DNSSEC validators. RFC5011 describes a method to update DNSSEC keys and a proper implementation is crucial for the root key rollover.
