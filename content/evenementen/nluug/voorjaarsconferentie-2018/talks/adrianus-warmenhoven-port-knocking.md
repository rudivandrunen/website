## Abstract

Using SPA for profit and fun, or, a zero-cost solution to getting your fridge out of Shodan.

Port knocking has been around for quite a while; send a sequence of packets to seemingly closed ports and Sesame opens up. This is, however, not so very secure. Single Packet Authentication port knocking, involving a signed packet with an timestamp, is a lot more secure and works quite well.

I want to make the case that, just like firewalling (IPTables), SPA port knocking should be a default mechanism in any modern OS, especially the IoT OSes. It is easily implemented (both on server and on client side) and is readily available. It takes the stress out of getting every underpaid worker on the same security page whilst still enabling access when needed.


And finally, it can be used (a hobby of mine) to waste tremendous amounts of time and resources of (wannabe) attackers; your server can be a Decepticon too!
