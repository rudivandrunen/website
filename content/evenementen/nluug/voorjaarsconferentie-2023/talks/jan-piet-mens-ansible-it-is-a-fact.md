## Abstract

Ansible facts are data obtained from target nodes which are made available on the controlling node to, say, determine operating system, RAM size, or network interfaces. Facts can be obtained from operating system values, gathered from files and programs you pre-install on nodes (local facts), or even returned by modules, and facts can be cached on the controlling node.

In this talk we'll talk facts: Ansible facts.
