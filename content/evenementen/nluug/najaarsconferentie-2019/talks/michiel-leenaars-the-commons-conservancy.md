## Abstract

Small projects can grow big, but why should every successful FOSS project bootstrap its own foundation, when this invokes all kinds of bureaucratic burdens? The Commons Conservancy is a hypervisor for virtual foundations, a meta-foundation set up to help mature upcoming efforts around open technologies.

The Commons Conservancy facilitates healthy and self-supporting ecosystems that are sustainable in the long term. It does so by providing a free (in all senses of the word) infrastructure for coordination as well as a proper legal framework for governance over contributions made to the projects. By collaboration with well-known charities like NLnet and dedicated service providers it can provide a turn-key charitable and business infrastructure for your FOSS efforts.
