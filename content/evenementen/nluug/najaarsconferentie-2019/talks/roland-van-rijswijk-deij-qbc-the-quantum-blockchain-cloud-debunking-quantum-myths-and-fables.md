## Abstract

In this talk I will focus on trying to discombobulate some of the common hypes and misunderstandings about the words quantum and cryptography in one sentence. This includes questions such as:

* Can everybody decrypt my TLS if quantum is a thing?

* Oh my god, quantum will be a thing next week, they're already selling 2000 qubit machines!

* Quantum cryptography will solve all my problems

* Post-quantum cryptography will solve all my problems

With a wink and a smile, the goal of this talk is to inform the audience about the real issues quantum computing may raise for Internet security and what they should and should not focus their energies on in dealing with this problem.
