## Abstract

Majority of Lawfirms today rely on older technology due to hyperfocus on security and scepticism over container technologies. As the rest of the world transition to containers, we discuss challenges in the lawfirms.

We propose an architecture to package applications, deliver, distribute and run third party vendor applications securely along with a method to capture and measure total cost of ownership.

We also discuss violation prevention effort that could be taken and a mitigation architecture in a scenario when there is a violation.
