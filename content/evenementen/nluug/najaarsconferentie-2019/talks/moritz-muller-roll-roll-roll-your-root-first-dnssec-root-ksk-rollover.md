## Abstract

I give an in-depth insight into the Root KSK Rollover of the DNSSEC key of last year. Together with researchers, operators and developers from five organizations we analyzed the first ever rollover of the main cryptographic keys of DNSSEC, which had the potential of rendering millions of Internet users offline.

I will show, why the rollover was postponed by one year, the impact of the rollover itself and the surprising behavior it triggered in resolver software. Our results also question the current distribution methods of the DNSSEC trust anchor, and other trust anchors like CAs.
