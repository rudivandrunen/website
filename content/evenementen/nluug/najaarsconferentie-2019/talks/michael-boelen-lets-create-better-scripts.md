## Abstract

Whether you call yourself a system administrator, developer, or DevOps sprint mediator, life is too short for sloppy shell scripts! In this talk, we look at how to improve them to stand the test of time. Michael will share how to create a good foundation for your scripts, so they run more reliable now and in the future. Your (future) colleagues might love you for it.

Focus areas of this presentation include error handling, security, style, and best practices. Also, it will cover (many) mistakes made by Michael over the last 20 years. Got some of your own? They are welcome as part of the discussion.
