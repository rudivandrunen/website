## Abstract

Just within the last fifteen years, we have seen at least two separate communities evolve from the generic idea of Systems Administration/Operations. The first, DevOps, grew up very much in public. The second, SRE, germinated within the halls of “special” companies like Google and Facebook and is now starting to gain significant visibility and traction in the wider world.

Join me for an introduction to SRE: what it is, why it matters, how it relates to other operations practices like DevOps, and if/how you can get started with it in your organization.
