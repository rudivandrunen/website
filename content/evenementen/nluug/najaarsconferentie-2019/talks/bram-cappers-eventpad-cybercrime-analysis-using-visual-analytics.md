## Abstract

Automation of malware analysis is a popular and very important topic, but with human cognition still outperforming AI we are still indispensable. In this talk we show how we can exploit the human eye for the analysis of large PCAP files and event logs using visual analytics.

At the TU/e we designed a system Eventpad to quickly visualize patterns and anomalies in event collections. In this talk we give live demos on how we can use the tool to discover fraud in VoIP traffic, discover chemical waste dumping in a wildlife preserve and reverse engineer Ransomware in back office environments.
