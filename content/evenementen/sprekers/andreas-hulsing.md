Andreas is a assistant professor for provable security in the Coding Theory and Cryptology group at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). He and his research group are currently supported by NWO under the Vidi grant “A solid theory for post-quantum cryptography”. Besides, Andreas is collaborating in the Formosa project to produce machine-checked proofs for high-assurance cryptographic software. His research focuses on post-quantum cryptography – cryptography that resists quantum computer-aided attacks. His works range from theoretical works, like how to model quantum attacks or formal security arguments in post-quantum security models, to applied works, like the analysis of side-channel attacks or the development of efficient hash-based signature schemes. In many of his works he tries to combine the theoretical and the applied perspective. This is especially reflected in his work on standardizing post-quantum cryptography.
