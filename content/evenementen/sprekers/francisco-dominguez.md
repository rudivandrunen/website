Bouncing between technical deep dives and board room chatter Francisco Dominguez has been involved with security (nowadays Cybersecurity) for the last 20 years and has kept track of some of it on his personal blog. Hacking and breaking different environments by combining technical knowledge and understanding of the surrounding process has always been his main passion. For example, he was involved in the investigation of the software and processes used to support the Dutch national elections. Unfortunately, those pesky commercial NDAs donâ€™t allow the naming of other fun jobs that involved social engineering people, jumping airgaps, fences or listening to hard disks to know if they are encrypted. Most of his offensive career he worked at Fox-IT and Securify, followed by working at Hunt & Hackett.
