Geert Rolf finished the Hogere Informatica Opleiding in 1982. He worked in a variety of jobs maintaining, developing and supporting Unix systems. He has been interested in computer history. The first computer he encountered is an Electrologica X1 that did not run UNIX. Next came PDP-11 and in 1977 he first touched the keyboard of a terminal connected to a UNIX machine. Geert collected old computers for a long time, but is now dismantling his Tehuis voor Bejaarde computers. He will keep some 32 and 64 bit machines for future hobby.
