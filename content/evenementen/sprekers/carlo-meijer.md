Carlo Meijer is a founding partner at Midnight Blue and a PhD candidate at Radboud University Nijmegen (RU). His research focuses on the analysis of cryptographic systems deployed in the wild. He is known for his work on the security of so-called Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs). Furthermore, he is known for breaking a hardened variant of Crypto1, the cipher used in the Mifare Classic family of cryptographic RFID tags. Finally, he co-authored research into default passwords in consumer routers as deployed by ISPs in the Netherlands. All three studies have uncovered major security shortcomings with widespread impact.
