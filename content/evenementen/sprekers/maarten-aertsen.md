Maarten Aertsen is senior internet technologist at NLnet Labs. Founded in 1999, NLnet Labs is a small, independent public benefit organisation contributing to the robustness, security and reliability of the Internet and the privacy of its users. The Internet runs on NLnet Labs: its open-source software and work on open standards for the Domain Name System and (safe) inter-domain routing are used globally.

Maarten's role is to bring NLnet Labs' expertise to policy making bodies, including governments, regulators and multi-stakeholder forums. As an engineer interested in the legal, social and economic factors underlying the working of the Internet, he enjoys bridging between technical and policy audiences.
