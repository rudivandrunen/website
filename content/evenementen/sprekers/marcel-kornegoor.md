Marcel earned a master's degree from Utrecht School of the Arts and after spending a couple of years as lead editor of a technical magazine, he started his IT career back in 2011. In 2018 he joined AT Computing and was promoted to CTO in early 2019. From that moment on he started to adapt the course of AT Computing towards containers, config management and cloud, with Linux at the core (of course) and a way of working that is heavily influenced by DevOps, LEAN and Continuous Delivery principles. Being brainwashed by the AT Computing gurus for over 4 years, he has become a huge fan of open source software. In his spare time he likes to spend time with his family or on his road bike or mountainbike.
