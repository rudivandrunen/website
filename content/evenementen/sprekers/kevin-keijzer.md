I have been working as a Senior IT Architect for the Almende Group - an R&D company based in Rotterdam - since 2017. I deal with all infrastructure, security and architecture-related matters for Almende and its subsidiaries. I am responsible for the daily management of all Linux and BSD servers in all kinds of locations, from bare metal to various cloud services. This includes web servers, mail servers, DNS servers, database servers, LDAP servers, VPN servers, file servers, backup servers, and so on, containing the most diverse software; from modern Docker containers to legacy Java code.

I also provide a lot of internal training to developers on architectural decisions, securing applications and networks and compliance with data processing legislation and modern (open) standards. In particular, the adoption and correct implementation of IPv6 is very important to me. If necessary - and therefore regularly - I audit new projects before they are put into production.

Before working at Almende, I worked for hosting providers, ISPs, network administrators and in enterprise print management, always in the role of UNIX administrator, network administrator and/or Kubernetes cluster administrator.

Outside of my work-related tasks, I have been involved in all kinds of open source development since I was a teenager. I have a lot of experience with boot firmware and router distributions in particular. In practice, this means that I work on coreboot for x86 computers, OpenWrt for ARM and MIPS routers, and, among other things, have done some work on the PinePhone software stack and replacement open source firmware for the EG25 LTE modem included in it. I always strive to ensure that all code running on my devices is 100% free and open source, and that the devices in question do not require firmware blobs to function. After all, being able to audit software yourself is the only way to make meaningful statements about security and integrity
